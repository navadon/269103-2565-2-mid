3. After one and a half years as an ISNE student, make some recommendations to prospective ISNE students. (Your answer must be at least 50 words long)

**Answer:** ...
First thing is about environment. Our teachers and seniors are professional. They’re very welcome to help you, if you have any kind of problems. I can survive through exams last term because of them. I think the most important thing is about motivation. If you really love coding and have motivation in it so you can learn any faculty not only in ISNE. However, here has a great team that supports you. Thus, if there’re any question you can contact us and the last thing I’ll say is my decision to be here is correct. Though some of courses are hard but I’m so happy to study here.
