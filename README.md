First and foremost, congratulations to everyone and a warm welcome to the ISNE family! This is the next chapter of your journey, and it is not like the previous ones. According to the quote from the original Spiderman movie, "With great power comes great responsibility", you need to be more responsible and more disciplined. My general recommendation is to live like you're playing a game. Most game developers have a strategy for attracting players by including a mission, a target, and a boss in each level. To be passionate about studying at university, I encourage you to set your goal. Even if it is in the short term or the long term, both are important when you feel like giving up. Following that, your missions can be simple or difficult. Of course, it is challenging, but doing the hard things will make you stronger. Keep fighting!!!
