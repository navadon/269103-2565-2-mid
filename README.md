## Questions

1. Write four basic Linux commands that you learned in the class that you believe are the most useful and provide a brief description in your own words. 

"ls" - This command is used to list the files and directories in a specified location.

"cd" - This command is used to change the current working directory.

"pwd" - This command is used to show the current directory path.

"rm" - This command is used to remove files and directories.

2. Explain what is “permission” in a file system and why it is important.

permissions refer to the access control settings that determine which users or groups of users can perform specific actions on a file or directory, such as reading, writing, or executing (r,w,x). Permissions are important because they provide a way to secure and protect files and directories from unauthorized access.

3. After one and a half years as an ISNE student, make some recommendations to prospective ISNE students. (Your answer must be at least 50 words long)

After 1 semester in ISNE i feel like this major is very interesting altho it may seem stressful at times but it is definitely not a bad time because you get to spend it with all your friends and get through it all together, grades are important but it's not the end of the world if you do dont do that well because at the end of the road it's the new people you met and experience you have gained along the way that matters the most.
