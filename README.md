## Questions

1. Write four basic Linux commands that you learned in the class that you believe are the most useful and provide a brief description in your own words. 

**Answer:** The most useful commands from most to least are in order:
            - ls command. I think it's the most important command ever because we need to look inside a directory to see what files are
            inside a directory. If we can't see them, we can't interact them and it'll make Linux practically useless.
            - echo command. We need it in order to read a file, otherwise files become useless like a notebook scribbled with foreign language you can't read.
            - cd command. It's very necessary. You need it to move around directory. They're like legs for our body, without them we can't move around.
            - clear command. It tidies texts after your work and brings you up to the top of the computer terminal. Very important in my opinion.
