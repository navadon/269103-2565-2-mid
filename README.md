## Questions

1. Write four basic Linux commands that you learned in the class that you believe are the most useful and provide a brief description in your own words. 

**Answer:** ...

#1 cd , to get in a file or directory depending on the current working directory by absolute paths or relative paths.

#2 cat, to read and to show the content in a file without having to open the file for editing.

#3 ls -l, to display the current working directory's file/directory and the permission detail for user.

#4 chmod, typing "chmod" following with "symbolic or numeric method" to change a file/directory permission type -- "r", "w" or "x".


2. Explain what is “permission” in a file system and why it is important.

**Answer:** ...

The detail of file when we type "ls -l" will include 4 parts that we need to concern. Three of these are the PERMISSION. The permission is the group of charaters that show us what the accessbility we have in the file/directory. Nine characters seperates to three for each owner--User owner, Group owner and others in respectively. In each three characters, there are 3 alphabet which are "r" "w" and "x". r means owner can read/copy/list. w means owner can write/edit/added/removed. x means owner can execute the file/get into the directory. It is important because we have to check the permission before we do something with the file. Without having permission, the user can not do what they want with the file.

3. After one and a half years as an ISNE student, make some recommendations to prospective ISNE students. (Your answer must be at least 50 words long)

**Answer:** ...

First and foremost, congratulations to everyone and a warm welcome to the ISNE family! This is the next chapter of your journey, and it is not like the previous ones. According to the quote from the original Spiderman movie, "With great power comes great responsibility", you need to be more responsible and more disciplined. My general recommendation is to live like you're playing a game. Most game developers have a strategy for attracting players by including a mission, a target, and a boss in each level. To be passionate about studying at university, I encourage you to set your goal. Even if it is in the short term or the long term, both are important when you feel like giving up. Following that, your missions can be simple or difficult. Of course, it is challenging, but doing the hard things will make you stronger. Keep fighting!!!
