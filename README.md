## Questions

1. Write four basic Linux commands that you learned in the class that you believe are the most useful and provide a brief description in your own words. 

**Answer:** ...

"ls" - This command allows you to view the files and directories in your current directory. It is useful for navigating and finding files on your system.

"cd" - This command allows you to change your current directory. It is useful for navigating to different parts of your file system.

"cp" - This command allows you to copy files or directories. It is useful for making backups of important files or for copying files to different locations on your file system.

"chmod" - This command allows you to changing permissions for linux user, group, and other users in the linux system. 


2. Explain what is “permission” in a file system and why it is important.

**Answer:** ...

In a file system, permissions refer to the access rights that users and groups have to files and directories. 
These rights determine who can read, write, or execute a file, and who can change the permissions or ownership of a file.

Permissions are important because they provide a way to control access to files and directories in a multi-user system. 
Without permissions, any user on the system would be able to read, write, or delete any file, regardless of whether or not they should have access to it. 
This would make it difficult to keep sensitive information secure and could lead to accidental data loss or corruption.
