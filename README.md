## Questions

1. Write four basic Linux commands that you learned in the class that you believe are the most useful and provide a brief description in your own words. 

**Answer:** 1) pwd command - print working directory; with this command, I can see which directory am I currently working on.
            2) ls command - list; with this command, I can list the files and directories within the system that I am working on.
            3) cp command - copy; with this command, I can copy files or directories.
            4) rm command - remove; with this command, I can remove or delete the files within the directory.

2. Explain what is “permission” in a file system and why it is important.

**Answer:** Permission in a fule system determines which users are permitted to do what actions on a file (read, write, exectute). It is important in the sense of data protection. If there are no permissions, then data might get leaked or it can harm the system.

3. After one and a half years as an ISNE student, make some recommendations to prospective ISNE students. (Your answer must be at least 50 words long)

**Answer:** As an ISNE student, I would say studying in this major is not too hard and not too easy. It requires a lot of effort and dedication in studying. There are subjects that seems to be so hard to handle, but I believe there are ways to be able to pass them. It is best to manage your time wisely. I have found out that, if you study too much or relax too much, either way is not an effective thing as a university student. We must balance our time. Also, one thing I found effective for studying is listening to the professor attentively in class. By this, it is most likely that we will understand the lessons.
