## Questions

1. Write four basic Linux commands that you learned in the class that you believe are the most useful and provide a brief description in your own words. 

**Answer:** 
1)  chmod is useful for changing permissions for linux user, group, and other users in the linux system. 
    It allows you grant or deny permission for anyone accessing the file or directory.
2)  ls (listing)is useful for viewing the contents of a directory and permission of each user group.
3)  > is important for redirecting contents from a command into a specified file
4)  echo is useful for displaying anything you write, this could be use to echo a word then redirect the word into a file would be helpful.

2. Explain what is “permission” in a file system and why it is important.

**Answer:** ...
Permission is important because it allows user to access a file or directory and permissions can prevent users from accessing a file or directory depending on the permissions they have. There are 3 types of permissions which are read, write, and execute. Read is for reading a file or directory, write is to write or edit a file or directory, and execute is running the file or granting permission to access the directory. There are 3 groups of users: users, group, and others. Each has it's own permissions that can be edited using chmod.

3. After one and a half years as an ISNE student, make some recommendations to prospective ISNE students. (Your answer must be at least 50 words long)

**Answer:** ...
So far, being an ISNE student has been challenging yet an exciting experince. I am a student fresh from high school transitioning into a different world of education. It was a drastic change in my life but I have come to embrace the new experience. There are many things that might be a bit different from how high school teachers used to teach but don't let those changes get to you. If I could summarize my first half of a year one student is study hard and play hard. You have a lot of free time, use it wisely and learn to have fun as well! I hope if you're interested in joining this major that we would be able to meet each other! Best wishes, Win.
