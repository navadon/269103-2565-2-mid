3. After one and a half years as an ISNE student, make some recommendations to prospective ISNE students. (Your answer must be at least 50 words long)

**Answer:** ...
To study for the ISNE you should have personal interest and passion in this field but if you don't you need serious dedication and disipline to get through the studies and exams. For me personally it is really hard to follow through and trying to study what is at the time very interesting and useful but if you don't have the resolve to be hard working and study these very subject it might be near impossible to pass many classes unless you are extremely gifted in learning or understanding of writing codes.
