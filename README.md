**Answer:** ...
When I came to study, I felt that I studied more about the software system or programs that I used to study, delve into what we learned more. What would recommend people who will come to study in this field or those who think they want to attend ISNE is to prepare a little about this field. Because otherwise it will not understand much And creating English is important for those who do not study international Or not that good at English And when studying, you have to listen to the teacher a little attention to understand what the teacher taught. When there is a problem, you have to ask the teacher or you will not understand. You can ask the previous year or friends for understanding. It is not recommended to leave what we will not understand because we will use it in the following years
