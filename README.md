## Questions

1. Write four basic Linux commands that you learned in the class that you believe are the most useful and provide a brief description in your own words. 

**Answer:** 1. cd (change directory): We often change directories when we need to do something like search for some files or navigate through files, so we need to use cd very frequently.
2. ls (list): after we navigate to the folder using the cd command, we also need to know the content in that directory, so we use the ls command. The ls command can also show the properties of the content.
3. sudo (super user do): When we need to do something that requires permission, we can use sudo to act as root (super user).
4. Reboot: There were occasionally updates for Linux that fixed issues with system security or performance. We need to restart the system frequently after these updates. 



2. Explain what is “permission” in a file system and why it is important.

**Answer:** In Linux, file permissions, attributes, and ownership control the access level that the system processes and users have to files. This ensures that only authorized users and processes have access to specific files and directories. These divide into three different classes of users: The file owner,the group, and the Others (everyone else). Each user class has three types of file permissions: read, write, and execute. We can view the file permissions of the file by using the ls command, and we can change the file permissions by using the chmod command.


3. After one and a half years as an ISNE student, make some recommendations to prospective ISNE students. (Your answer must be at least 50 words long)

**Answer:** To become a student at ISNE and to fully understand the course, you must study programming fundamentals. Also required are calculus and physics from high school. By understanding the basic principles of programming, calculus, and physics, one can move forward to more advanced topics that are part of the ISNE course. The content will get harder and harder. When you feel you don't understand that topic, you need to act fast! There's no need to be shy about asking you, a professor, or a friend. Asking questions is the best way to break down the barriers of confusion and build a strong understanding of the concepts. For me, who has primarily studied alone for the past six months, it is necessary to make friends and study with them in order to better comprehend difficult topics and help each other.
